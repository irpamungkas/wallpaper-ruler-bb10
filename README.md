# Wallpaper Ruler

Do you like taking pictures, choosing the perfect image and editing it to make it *the* perfect wallpaper? *the* one? Yeah?! Then this application is for you!

The Wallpaper Ruler is a free mobile application for BlackBerry10® devices and for Wallpaper lovers! The Wallpaper Ruler will help you visualize how an image will look like as a wallpaper on a BlackBerry10®.

Choosing the perfect image, editing it to make it the perfect wallpaper for your device is valuable for everyone. But can you imagine an app that provides the user an optimal usage of a device while modifying or editing a wallpaper? Look for example at the device state: a locked screen is different from the unlocked, so setting up a wallpaper will be! Do you know an app doing that differently?

Our application is the one! The Wallpaper Ruler enables the BlackBerry10® users to modify/edit an image with the best, instantaneous and spontaneous experience based on the different requests, as the device state. Not convinced yet that the best user experience is our main goal?! What about this:

* our app will know that an image was unsafe if the same was again picked for editing - we prompt the user to continue from the last saved version
* our app will give the possibility to use the cameras of the device directly in the app - you don't want to miss the perfect shoot for your locked screen
* our app allows the user to use social media to spread the word about the Wallpaper Ruler app
* *we are preparing more, way more on this, soon*

We thruly believe that setting up a Wallpaper can be fun, intuitive and quick! Our application will contribute with an unique and natural experience to all of that.

## How do we roll?
Our Application started with a competition and evolved to be a group initiative: bringging to life a free cool product! This is how we roll! 

Take a look below to understand how we organized our project folders.

### design
All images, icons, sketches, mockups and everything related to the graphical design, user interface of the app.

### docs
All documents related to the app documentation like manuals, release notes and etc.

##This is us:

This initiative is based on a group of international friends: curious, bored by the status-quo, willing to make the difference. Nice to meet us:
